    "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
    "    - Python is a high-level, versatile programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It's popular for web development, data science, machine learning, and scripting due to its simple syntax, extensive libraries, and strong community support.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
    "    - In Python, an interpreter is a program that directly executes Python code without prior compilation into machine code. It translates the high-level Python code line by line into lower-level instructions that the computer can understand and execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
    "    - Predefined keywords in Python are reserved words that hold specific meanings and functionalities within the language. These keywords are fundamental to Python's syntax and structure, and they cannot be used as identifiers such as variable names, function names, or class names.\n",
    "    Ex: False, None, True, And, class etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
    "    - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names. Keywords are reserved words in a programming language that have predefined meanings and are used to define the language's syntax and structure. Using them as variable names would lead to syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. what is mutability in python?\n",
    "    - In Python, mutability refers to whether an object's state or content can be changed after it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
    "    - The reason for the tuple's immutability is that once the elements are added to the tuple and the tuple has been created; it remains unchanged,While lists are mutable because you can change the order of items in a list or reassign an item in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
    "    - The \"==\" operator checks for equality of values which means it evaluates whether the values of two objects are the same. On the other hand, \"is\" operator checks for identity, meaning it determines whether two variables point to the same object in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
    "    - Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements and evaluate expressions based on their truth values (True or False).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
    "    - Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of converting one data type into another.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
    "    - In implicit type casting, the programming language automatically converts data from one type to another if needed. For example, if you have an integer variable and you try to assign it to a float variable, the programming language will automatically convert the integer to a float, While Explicit type casting, also known as type conversion or type coercion, occurs when the programmer explicitly converts a value from one data type to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
    "    - Conditional statements in Python are used to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions. These statements help control the flow of a program, making it behave differently in different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. How does the elif statement work ?\n",
    "    - The elif statement is a conditional control flow statement used in multiple conditions sequentially. If the if condition is False, the program then proceeds to evaluate the condition of the first elif statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
    "    - For loops are designed for situations where the number of iterations is known in advance, while loops are more flexible and can handle situations where the number of iterations is unknown or depends on a dynamic condition.\n",
    "    - For loops often have their initialization and increment/decrement within the loop's structure, while loops usually have initialization outside the loop, and the increment/decrement is placed within the loop's body.\n",
    "    - For loops have a condition that is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration. while continue executing as long as their condition remains true.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
    "    - Using while loop\n",
    "\n",
    "      int counter = 0;\n",
    "      while (counter < 10) {\n",
    "          //do some task\n",
    "          if(some condition){\n",
    "              break;\n",
    "          }\n",
    "      }\n",
    "      useTheCounter(counter); // method which use that value of counter do some other task\n",
    "      \n",
    "      In this case I found while loop is better than for loop because if i want to achieve the same in for loop i have to assign the value of counter to another variable.\n"
